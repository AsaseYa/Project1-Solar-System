                <p>I'm sure the universe is full of intelligent life. It's just been too intelligent to come here. The Earth
                is the cradle of humanity, but mankind cannot stay in the cradle forever. Those who came before us made
                certain that this country rode the first waves of the industrial revolutions, the first waves of modern
                invention, and the first wave of nuclear power, and this generation does not intend to founder in the
                backwash of the coming age of space. We mean to be a part of it--we mean to lead it. For the eyes of the
                world now look into space, to the moon and to the planets beyond, and we have vowed that we shall not
                see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace. We have vowed that
                we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and
                understanding.</p>
