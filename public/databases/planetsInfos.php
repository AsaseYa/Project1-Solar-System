            "Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being
                larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often
                referred to as the \"Red Planet\". The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on
                Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance (as
                shown), that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a
                terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters
                of the Moon and the valleys, deserts and
                polar ice caps of Earth.",
            "The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well as the
                tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site of Olympus
                Mons, the largest volcano and highest known
                mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in
                the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the Northern Hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and
                may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and
                irregularly shaped.
                These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan."
